This project implements a punch clock system for clients to use for their employees. The goal of this project is to allow an easy and accessible clock to provide convenience to both employees and the employers to punch in and out of work. The features of this system will allow employees to clock in and out for work with a unique ID and pin. The employees will also be able to view their own time card. The administrator, or client, will have individual access to their employees' time card information; with the ability to search for an individual’s information. This level of security will ensure that only the administrator has access to each employee’s information. The last feature is that the admin will have the ability to add existing users to their employee list. The ideal clients who could benefit from this program are employers of small to medium-sized companies who wish to have a simple punch card system for their employees.  This is also ideal for clients who wish for their employees to have easy access to their punch history.
